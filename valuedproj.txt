                       COME TO THE ALTER (Elevation Worship)

Verse 1
Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling


CHORUS
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ


Verse 2
Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today there's no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes a new life is born
Jesus is calling (Oh, oh)


CHORUS
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
2x


BRIDGE

Savior
What a Savior

Oh, what a Savior
Isn't He wonderful?
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
Bow down before Him
For He is Lord of all
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
2X


CHORUS
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
Tell the world of the treasure you found.

                              OVERCOME (By Jeremy Camp)



Seated above, enthroned in the Father's love
Destined to die, poured out for all mankind
God's only Son, perfect and spotless one
He never sinned but suffered as if He did
All authority
Every victory is Yours
All authority
Every victory is Yours
Savior, worthy of honor and glory
Worthy of all our praise, You overcame
Jesus, awesome in power forever
Awesome and great is Your name, You overcame
Power in hand speaking the Father's plan
You're sending us out, light in this broken land
All authority
Every victory is Yours
Savior, worthy of honor and glory
Worthy of all our praise, You overcame, you overcame
Jesus, awesome in power forever
Awesome and great is Your name, You overcame
We will overcome by the blood of the Lamb
And the word of our testimony, everyone overcome
We will overcome by the blood of the Lamb
And the word of our testimony, everyone overcome
We will overcome by the blood of the Lamb
And the word of our testimony, everyone overcome
We will overcome by the blood of the Lamb
And the word of our testimony, everyone overcome
Savior, worthy of honor and glory
Worthy of all our praise, you overcame, you overcame
Jesus, awesome in power forever
Awesome and great is Your name, You overcame
You overcame
You overcame
You overcame
Savior, worthy of honor and glory
Worthy of all our praise, you overcame
Jesus, awesome in power forever
Awesome and great is Your name, You overcame
